The following packages need to be installed, to run the code: pandas, nltk, numpy, tensorflow, optuna, scikit-learn, gensim

You can run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install them all in one command.

Make sure you have all files in the same folder, to be able to run the model.

To run the code, you will need to run "main.py"

We used optuna to find our best parameters, but if you want to train the model yourself and find your own parameters, edit the model.py file, changing the cnn filters in the objective function
