That's a pretty simple process. :),0
"This is truly interesting. Should this technology prove practical, it may be possible to look at integrating it into water purification facilities. Interesting.",0
It's going to be necessary at water treatment facilities.,0
"Oh that’s easy! But first, they must charge an arm and a leg so you won’t need to worry about anything because you won’t be able to afford it",0
"I am assuming that you mean to filter the plastics from open waters that are contaminated, eg rivers, lakes, and oceans. Unfortunately, like most filtration and purification technology, this will likely only be relevant to potable water. The inhabitants of any ecosystem would be damaged by this almost as much as the plastics themselves. In all water there is no way to remove the microorganisms which make up the bottom of the food chain without damaging them, so you couldn't pass the water through the filter and maintain the diversity. Also, this would likely filter other, naturally occurring organic molecules which these ecosystems use to survive.
For oceans, all of the above, plus issues dealing with salinity, which I would suspect could damage the filter and not release water of similar salinity to the source, not sure which way, that would cause issues with death bubbles and such.",0
"I think the big problem would be more so, ""how do we remove microplastics without removing all the needed things in the water?"" Say if we use it on rivers, filtering would also remove very small water life that fish feed on. It would also remove things like the small particles of slit that gets slowly deposited on shores that later goes on to help land be more fertile. In the ocean, it would have similar problems. There are too many small things in natural waters that would be filtered out that needs to stay in for the environment. 

This is great for drinking water but to make a product or system that can remove only microplastics would be insanely difficult if not impossible, at least for now. There is no telling what we will figure out in the future.",0
"I answered this myself a tiny part, looking at abstracts only, a bit more. A bit of searching:



But that has nothing on what pollutants may be created or develop or are left from manufacturing, if they are used. 

But does say “Covalent triazine frameworks(CTFs) as a new type of porous organic polymers(POPs) with nitrogen-rich content, high chemical stability, visible light sensitive, metal-free and fully conjugated structure” which is great, as it gives me a starting-point. 



Mentions CTFs still can have metals. 



This suggests there are hundreds of different structures, of COFs alone. 

“What is the difference between a MOF and a COF?
A metal organic framework can be pictured as a combination of metal atoms (or clusters) as nodes, with organic linkers. In a COF (or Covalent Organic Framework) these metal 'nodes' are instead replaced by a non-metal such as boron or nitrogen.

These COF structures are much less common (with less than 600 structures reported so far) and even fewer with published crystal structures.”

I assume MOFs are different to COFs with metals in them. It did mention a difference between 2d and 3d COFs and MOFs, where some are single layers of atoms, much like graphite sheets. 



This tells me that the atomic assembly can be completely free from metals. 

Still nothing on biosafety, recyclability, or on biocompatibility, or on manufacturing sustainability, or inputs of materials and their sustainability. 



Even in single atom thick layers (imagine a flat paper puzzle, instead of a pile or pallet of atomic bricks) it’s able to filter salt water. 

Going away from the science, especially as it’s not closely related to the CTFs mentioned that filter microplastics, there’s another popular magazine article here. 



And from that, I note that again, nothing is mentioned about the sustainability of manufacturing, of how safe it is, what it breaks down to in the environment, what the results of eating or drinking that nano-manufactured non-natural engineered material is, weather it would be safe if your children were swimming in water contaminated with materials leftover from the filter, or how even it’s manufactured, and what costs and waste products exist. 

I was only yesterday looking at F-gases, and the consequences of manufacturing post-it notes, and LCD screens and golf club carts, and how bad it is when companies discharge tonnes to hundreds or thousands or millions of tonnes of industrial pollutants. 

So sadly, all the text that appears shows nothing and gives no clues as to the safety, sustainability and recyclability of the ‘Covalent triazine frameworks’.

If there’s an issue that recycling is only reliable at scale, I think the history of plastics manufacturing has demonstrated how massive scale leads to competitive pressures and market forces drive down the prices to the point where no recycling is possible, as it’s commercially unviable in any comprehensive way. Actually, the collapse of a recycler in Australia, who only had one job - to recycle soft plastics, eg. Grocery and food bags, where said plastics are mostly well described as they are food safe ones, clearly highlights how absolutely dangerous it is to create filters that themselves might be a problem to recycle if they are made at any scale.",0
"It's reusable with little degradation, however many uses that means is not detailed in the abstract. Considering it's a new material, recycling will depend on a lot of factors. It seems to be a complex shape of a more basic material that has other uses, so it may be recyclable.",0

"50 year old who has been working in environmental conservation for longer than Greta has been alive.

There are a *lot* of us who have been actively working on dealing with the issues she raises, and have been doing so for a very long time. Even back when I was a little kid there were a lot of folks who had recognized the problems and were working to curtail or stop them.

Greta is just one among many making noise and doing things to help.  The media has latched onto here and made her the ‘public face’ of all this, but she is far from the only one and far from the first.

All due credit to her, but it’s a *group* effort to address and fix the problems, not something that people can pin their hopes onto one person to ‘save’ us.

Part of his messge was that he’s proud of having a lack of empathy for others, and a lack of empathy is always weakness. And why? He has enormous priviledge. Who knows, he may have big body parts.

As a European i actually like the move. Europe and especially Germany constantly lacked at least one ball in dealing with Russia. This way, the decision to may still buy a little gas from Putin or whom ever comes after him is taken away.

"Also, we should put them above freeways. LA could power the whole country lol",0
"The reasons why are as follows:

1. Cost of steel to raise panels high enough over cars and trucks.
2. Cost of trenching and repairing through pavement to install and maintain conduits and cables. 
3. Need to have access to interconnection point (i.e. transmission line).
4. Most parking lots have buildings near and around them which could create shading impacts. 
5. Raising panels higher from ground means you have to install larger deeper foundations. Much more steel.
6. The private owner of the parking lot would have to be interested in installing. Solar developers don't have site control. They would have to negotiate leases. Parking lots and shopping center change ownership. Complicates land control, and increases risk.
7. Dumb people driving around expensive assets is just not good in general.
8. Most large scale utility needs other supporting infrastructure like a switch yard or substation. This would take away parking spots. Most developers install the minimum required parking spots per zoning regulations. Meaning they would need to apply for and request zoning variance. 
9. Parking lots are hot. Heat is not good for solar panels. 
10. Solar panels would likely have to be fixed tilt which aren't as efficient as trackers.",0

Anyone living in a desert thinks is a great idea.  Children and pets die in hot cars.  People regularly burn themselves on hot leather car seats,0
Yeah people are not being imaginative enough here. We need to build housing and mixed use developments on these parking lots and then solar on top of that.,0
This is the way,0
best answer,0
"Truth, we need to build walkable cities and get rid of cars",0
"Exactly. Has everyone in this thread gone insane? We have ample space to build solar farms outside city limits, but these people are suggesting we waste valuable urban space that could be better used to build affordable housing, parks and transit stops. This is a prime example of greenwashing.",0
"For sure. But one of the (very few) advantages of surface parking is that they are easier to upgrade to housing, or other higher value urban usages. It's harder to get rid of multi story parking garages. If the solar panels are put in place with the idea that the can be removed in 10 or 20 or 30 years, and designed to be reinstalled elsewhere (think everything except the foundation piles), it could be a useful use of the land at present, while leaving room for improved urban landuse. 

Getting rid of cars and parking lots is good, but expecting all parking lots to be removed in the next 10 years is totally unrealistic. We need multiple solutions that can be done in shorter periods of time. 

But yeah, we need to *start* getting rid of surface parking now, and improving our built environments to be walkable, bikeable, and with good public transport.",0

"> The activist’s dilemma: Extreme protest actions reduce popular support for social movements.

The issue is that people already don't care about climate change. Climate activists have warned people for decades at this point. Climate change is an incredibly well researched area of study with new papers being released probably every single day. There are tons of books, documentaries, radio shows, interviews, talks, etc. produced by scientists and experts explaining what the is and how to address it. And more. 

But people continue to do nothing about it. They don't make simple changes in their own life. Fair enough. They don't vote for politicians that want to do something about climate change ""because they have more pressing issues"". Fair enough. But they also never, ever bothered in their life to tell their politicians that they even care about this at all.

I don't think ""extreme"" actions, and that is really pushing the meaning of the word ""extreme"", actually reduce support, but it is an easy way for people to blame their inaction and past behaviour on someone else.",0

"I think the big thing there is money. If they're regularly giving away free wood off cuts to anyone, then they reduce demand, and lose money. If they send it to the dump, or even just one person, then it doesn't really affect that though. Not that that makes it okay, just shows that it's a problem of systems, not idiocy",0
"sometimes wood gets treated, and some products used in that process should definitely not be burned.",0
"Or they could heat their own place with it. Literally every joinery shop I've worked in used a stove heated by offcuts to heat the shop, one of them even had the office strategically placed in the top floor so it heated the office space as well",0
"That’s what I was thinking too. Based on the current state of woodworking YouTube with videos like, “Turning a free pallet into a $1500 table??” This is like half a million dollars worth of furniture and cutting boards lmao",0

"The stamps actually tell you how it's treated, I make sure it has the ""HT"" instead of ""PT"" meaning heat treated, not pressure treated. I don't burn stained wood. I talked to the guys as well, it's clean, untreated wood. People don't usually like to pressure treat fine wood for indoor furniture, it would be very strange.",0
"Fair warning, however the wood coming from a wood shop is extremely unlikely to be pressure treated. Pt is pretty exclusively used in construction and if you find a wood shop that uses it they probably don’t use much hardwood.",0

"Unfortunately fireplaces are not very efficient. Most of the heat goes right up the chimney, and also there may be some combustible gas that goes up the chimney as well. Stoves are a lot better in this regard. They have a far better efficiency of burning their fuel. They also retain their heat by virtue of their material (cast iron is most common but stone or tiles and a couple of others are also possible). Another advantage is that you get less smoke (not no smoke) inside of your house because stoves have a door. Breathing smoke is not healthy. Some small cast iron stoves can be placed inside a fireplace without adaptations so I’d look into that if I were you!",0
"Stoves > fireplaces. By like, a lot.",0
Masonry heater is the way to go! Can’t believe there are not more of them. ,0
"I've been looking into getting a fireback to improve the heat we get out of the fireplace. It's a thick sheet of cast iron that's often decorated. They're supposed to reflect heat from the fire back towards the front of the fireplace.

I've found a few YouTube videos on how to tweak a fireplace to get more heat out of it, I've found them really helpful but unfortunately didn't save any. They're also really dependant on your setup. Some have to do with how you vent your fire, some with what you burn, a few had suggestions like the fireback.

I do remember one that talked about managing expectations. With a good fireplace the masonry around it will warm up after a couple of hours and retain that heat for a long time. That does happen with my 60's fireplace, though it doesn't get incredibly warm.",0
Very well. I grew up in a 1200 sqft house and the only heat was out one wood burning stove in the living room. It snowed all winter. It heated up the house pretty quickly too.,0
If you have room for ducting you can put an extra flue around your flue and pump that captured heat to the rest of your house.,0
"Not really. Our house had a wood stove when we moved in, but it was one of the very few in the neighborhood that did, and I never saw smoke coming from any other chimney pipe. I think most people with fireplaces and wood stoves don’t bother to use them, or only use them occasionally for ambience. 

We don’t have one anymore because our house was gutted by a fire several years ago - NOT the fault of the wood stove, but I couldn’t face having indoor fire again after that :/ I sure missed it the following winter when our power was out for two days, though!",0
"PNW. It's a small shop, wouldn't be crazy for none of them to have a wood stove.",0
Wood stoves are out of style for most folks due to convenience. My uncle has a lot of extra wood and was clearing a lot so he had more than he could use in 20 years. Offered it up to the local heating assistance program with free splitting and delivery. They refused and said they only deal with oil and gas heat assistance.,0
"I've worked in plenty of shops with lots of free scrap wood, but I've never had a wood stove.

I knew a guy who had a wood fired, forced air furnace. He swore that it was legit, and I believe him (he was a precise fellow). Basically it was a wood stove with a heat exchange and fan that would circulate the heat throughout the house.

The convenience of heating your whole house with the inconvenience of getting up to stoke the fire in the morning. Interesting trade off if you have enough free wood.",0
"I guess this is the difference between the environmental mindset to zero waste and the frugal mindset to zero waste.

The mindset in this post is to heavily prioritise the frugal end, making the most of what's available for free in his/her area rather than ""letting it go to waste"" in a dump somewhere. If you have very little money at your disposal, environmental concerns go out the window if you can get free heating for next to nothing.

Judging from the sidebar, this sub seems to be leaning towards the environmental mindset; a more considerate place to post this would probably be r/Frugal.",0
"So it's not perfect, but burning wood is carbon neutral as long as trees are planted at replacement value. Also you are replacing other forms of heat. 60% of electricity in the US is from from fossil fuels. Also see natural gas, propane, etc. The stove itself is a certified EPA stove, and it reburns the smoke before it goes up the chimney, so it has way fewer particulates than older stoves. It's generally clear when burning - can't see any smoke. Solar panels on the house would probably be better but I'm not able to have that right now.",0
"Only bad for carbon if you compare it to not heating. Does put more particulate in the air which is a local environmental/air quality concern. It would be bad for air quality if everybody burned wood, but using some local/renewable/waste wood as fuel isn’t ‘terrible’.",0
Would you say that burning the wood is the lesser of two evils?,0
"I'd be willing to bet a lot of people commenting don't actually know where their heating comes from. I'm burning clean, local trash, and I'm not getting it from a coal burning power plant powering the electric grid. Pollution is still there even if you can't see it being made!",0
"So, the people running this shop have not been able to find anyone who wants it, that's why they were paying money to send it to the dump. They posted about it online and I was the only one that responded. Also, most homes are heated by burning gas and fossil fuels (electricity in the US is 60% fossil fuel burning). Wood burning, as long as trees are being planted at replacement value, is carbon neutral.",0
"That's a very broad and misleading statement. Wood heating can be very efficient. I lived in a 10 acre forest for over a 10 years and while I did buy wood, about half the wood I used came from trees in my forest that were at the end or near the end of their lifespan. I had a very small cabin and it didn't take much to get that place up to temperature with not that much wood. I would easily spend $150 a month or more on propane per month depending how cold it was or how expensive propane was when I didn't have wood. It saved me a bunch of money and I considered it very efficient.",0
But it was just going to the landfill,0
Also horrible for local air quality,0
"Wood burning carbon emissions are hardly ""working out for the planet""",0
"Sorry about your breathing problems. I try to be respectful and make sure that there is no visible smoke, If a neighbor approaches me I might adjust my routine but it has never happened. Lots of rain where I live that keeps the air clean and I don't burn on days with poor air quality. This is wood that no one wants, is going to the dump (where it would release carbon once it breaks down), and it's displacing burning fossil fuels, which just pollutes someone else's neighborhood.",0

If solar expands at 25% a year and wind at 15%, both slightly under their current rate, and hydro loses 20% of it's present output a year until hitting 0 in 2026, the US would still be hitting over half of present demand covered by renewables in 2030.",0

Litter surveys consistently find cigarette butts to be the most common form of litter worldwide.

As long as the battery doesn't suffer a manufacturing defect or mechanical impact/failure there is no reason why they won't significantly outlast the rest of the vehicle. At the end of the service life they can also be recycled/remanufactured or repurposed for grid storage capacity.,0
"Hertz sells that cars well before this is an issue.  Generally you can get 3000+ charges and it won't die, you'll just see a reduction in capacity over time, but the battery management systems are getting really good and keeping them working longer and longer (by running in optimal conditions.)

In all likelihood you'll be able to buy reconditioned batteries at a very reasonable price once they start failing en masse.

But today, if your 10 year old LR Model 3 needs a new battery it will cost you $15k.  If you can salvage a battery from a totaled car or find a refurbished battery you might be able to do it for $5-10k. 

Other cars (with smaller batteries) will be cheaper, but also might need to be replaced sooner as the capacity loss will have more of an impact on usable range.

For long term costs...  today I use about $0.03/mi in electricity.  If after 300,000 miles I have to spend $15k you could add $0.05/mi to that cost.  It's still 20% cheaper than gas at $4/gal getting a high 40 mpg.",0

Some manufactures are going beyond this such as Rivian trucks which are under warranty for 8 years or until 175,000 miles (Rivan, 2022), or Tesla Model S which are under warranty for 8 years or until 150,000 miles which guarantees battery capacity over 70% over the 8-year warranty period (Tesla, 2022).

I've owned the car for over 8 years and I estimate I've saved around $7,000 in gas vs. electric, I still have the original brake pads, so another $1,500 saved in brake work?  I get an oil change every two years instead of two or three per year, so another $1,200 saved in oil changes.  I'm on my third set of tires, where I would normally expect to be on my second set, so add $500.  Overall I conservatively estimate that I've save about $9k or $10k over the time I've owned the car.

Manufacturing and assembly is much simpler as well. Currently vehicle sticker price is dominated by one component - the battery - but that's rapidly plummeting in cost.

"Starting forty-five years ago I was in a climate where heat pumps were used. That was probably very early in mass-market deployment, though. A decade earlier, in the 1960s, ""all electric"" houses were being sponsored by the local power company, that were highly insulated with 50% thicker studs, but used resistance heating and not heat pumps.

Acceptance of heat pumps regionally is a factor of lowest expected temperatures, I think. If the local HVAC industry believes that ambient temperatures were low enough to engage the emergency resistance heating in a heat pump, they'd steer their customers away from them. But I know that the new lower-temperature heat pumps have already been resulting in a slow adoption in areas formerly heated by oil, propane, or gas. The low-efficiency non-condensing furnaces are the low-hanging fruit.",0
"In the UK they're many times more expensive than gas boiler, same running cost, and harder to find an installer who will do the job well.

I’ve noticed this sub has quite a number of trolls on all the energy efficiency issues for whatever reason,0
It's amazing that with all the information about heat pumps that only 10% of the global heating/cooling is provided by them. I wonder what the reason is...,0
"The problem is the energy grid can't even keep up with current demands with reliability.    Add in more electric cars on top of that.  And if you have a heat pump you may still need a furnace as a backup when the temps get cold enough.  That may be a gas furnace or electric heating strips

Heat pumps also require more maintenance than a standard gas furnace and that is expensive.",0

"Might be time to upgrade insulation, I see lots of people strapping and putting on foam board to the exterior. Helps with cold transfer and adds a bit of R value. 1"" I think is about R5. Seems like an easier upgrade to the home than doing it to the interior. might also be an underpowered heat pump setup. Did you have a heat loss calculation done?",0
The winter performance has little to do with it being a heat pump system and everything to do with that system’s capacity and the insulation of the house. An undersized forced air furnace or wood stove would also fall short. It seems odd to write off an entire technology that achieves **efficiencies well above 100%** simply because it doesn’t work miracles when it isn’t applied well.,0
"Assuming it's wood pellets. The carbon dioxide they release has recently been in the atmosphere (for example 25-50 years ago I dunno how long trees live for). Whereas fossil fuels release carbon that hasn't been in the atmosphere in millennia. Hence why it's neutral.

It's the extra carbon dioxide we are releasing that has been locked away underground (i.e coal, gas) that is causing the climate change not co2 that trees have sucked out the atmosphere a few decades ago.",0
Better running a heat pump until it gets too cold and then supplementing with an auxiliary option instead of running a fossil furnace all the time regardless.,0
"Air conditioners work by taking heat from inside and pumping it outside. The end result is a cooler inside.

A heat pump is just that but in reverse, it pumps the heat inside.

Most units now are able to switch between these modes, to cool in summer and heat in winter.",0
"When a gas becomes a liquid it releases heat and when a liquid boils to become a gas it takes in heat from the environment. If you bring a pot of water to a boil, you’ll notice that a thermometer in the pot would rise in temperature at a steady rate until it reaches 100C. The water will stay at this temperature. Your stove is still adding heat to the water at the same rate but all of that energy is going into changing the phase of the water. 

Adding heat isn’t the only way to change phases. You can also do this by changing pressure with a compressor.

So a heat pumps works by using a refrigerant that boils in outside temperatures (say a fluid that boils at -20C). In boiling off it has taken some energy from outside. This gas is then compressed as it enters your house (this is where a heat pump uses electricity). At the higher pressure the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and gives off its heat. The refrigerant then goes outside where the pressure is lower and boils off. 

This is the cycle that’s taking heat from the outside for your houses and using the latent heat of phase changes to provide heat even though your house is warmer than outside. A heat pump still needs electricity for its compressor the heat pump itself can heat your home by 2-3 times the electrical input. That’s what makes them so efficient.

TL;DR you can move heat from a cold place to a warm place through the magic of phase changes.",0
"To add to the other responses, something like a resistive baseboard heater will take (for example) 1500 watts of electricity and turn 100% of that into heat.  A heat pump can move 1500 watts of heat ""uphill"" from a colder outside to a warmer inside using less than 1500 watts of electricity.  It kind of sounds like it's breaking the laws of physics, but it's not because the thermal energy was already present in the environment, just at a lower temperature.  There's a limit to how low of an outside temperature it will work at, though.",0
It converts ambient heat into concentrated heat using electricity.,0
like an air conditioner but reversable,0
"If you've ever used a can of compressed air, you'll notice it gets cold as you release the pressurized air. Heat pumps do the same thing - sucks in heat when it releases compressed fluid, then passes it back thru a radiator and fan to cool it off before recompressing. 

Now you can move heat from outside inside or other way (AC) for the cost of compressing gas. 

Also, mountain weather works this way as air takes on or releases heat when it loses or gains altitude (lower pressure higher you go). Look up Santa Ana winds",0
[Here's a good video](,0
"I'm actually curious if a substantial part of the demand growth is not driven by demand for heating but for cooling.  A heart pump is just an AC that can run in reverse, and Europe, like the rest of the world, is getting warmer.  Places that used to not need cooling in the Summer are starting to get hotter.",0
"I've rarely encountered hot water heating, so I don't know that much, but I don't understand why you'd change everything.

Heat pump based water heating systems are totally a thing already, and they just pipe into the existing system. You're just replacing one kind of boiler with another.",0
Does the UK look into district heating? That is often the best solution.,0
"A heat pump won't really save much if any money against gas at UK prices. Hopefully that'll change long term with more renewables coming online and gas becoming more scarce, but I think we're talking decades. We really need some strong government intervention to make this happen. Good on you for doing the right thing though.",0
"Moving heat from one zone to another is very much more efficient than turning chemical energy directly into heat -- even when you factor in efficiency losses from turning the original chemical energy into electricity, transmitting it to a home, and using it to pump refrigerant through condensers and radiators.  And long term, we expect to replace most of those natural gas electric plants with renewable solar/wind/etc.;  this replacement won't help the heating unless you switch to electric.

edit: some numbas:

A high-efficiency gas furnace turns about 95% of the combustable gas energy into heat.

A high-efficiency gas power plant turns 50-60% of the gas energy into electricity. National averages show about 5% loss from transmission and conversion. You get about 45% of gas energy arriving at your heat pump (as a floor).

An air-source heat pump moves 250-500% as much heat as its input energy.  250% \* 45% => 112% which is greater than the 95% you got directly burning the gas in your furnace.  Even with fossil fuel powered electricity generation; heat pumps make sense, as we move to increasing amounts of renewable electricity generation, they make more and more sense.",0
You can move 2-5x as much heat per energy consumed than you can get by just converting that energy into heat.,0
"While heat pumps do require electricity, most of the time it's still better to use them over natural gas for heat. Most natural gas power plants are around 50% thermal efficiency (50% of the heat that is released by burning the natural gas is converted to electricity), while most heaters are around 95% efficient.

Where heat pumps shine is their coefficient of performance is somewhere around 3-5 or more, depending on the outside temperature. That means for every joule of electricity consumed, it will result in 3-5 joules of heating in the house. It does that by moving the energy from the ambient environment into the house. So even though the power plant is 50% efficient in terms of turning the heat from burning natural gas into electricity, that electricity can be multiplied by 3-5 times of effective heating in a building.

Obviously if you live somewhere that is very cold for a long period of time (below \~10°), there may not be much benefit of moving from a natural gas heater to a natural gas powered heat pump. However that climate isn't an extremely large part of the US. Also, electrifying heating has the additional benefit of becoming more clean as the grid becomes more clean as more wind and solar power come online. Overall it doesn't make sense everywhere, but they are a great option to install now especially if you are already going to be installing a AC unit.",0
"A heat pump running off of gas will heat an area better than burning that gas, it’s more efficient. And then as we switch away from gas sources, even better.",0
"it's more efficient to move heat into your house with a heat pump run on a natural gas generator than it is to burn the natural gas to create heat.  


just in case 1000 people haven't told you yet.",0
"A heat **pump** and an electric (resistance) heater are not the same.

The electric heater you're actually talking about will turn 1 electric kWh into 1 thermal kWh.

Meanwhile a heat pump will turn 1 electric kWh and outside air into 3-4 thermal kWh and much colder outside air that gets carried away by the wind.

And just like that the thermal kWh produced by a heat pump is cheaper than the thermal kWh you get from burning natural gas.",0
"It's a logical question to ask. And yes depending on where you live your grid is probably >50% fossil fuel powered. But I think most major utilities have near carbon zero goals. So the idea is that as the grid gets greener, your electric appliances carbon footprint shrinks.

"Large scale hydro [or other gravitatational supply] is not as casual as you seem to think, because it takes a LOT of mass to store a moderate [by our standards] amount of energy. 

Let's say we want to supply electricity to a thousand Americans for ten hours, roughly ""overnight"" . Or ten thousand Americans for an hour, like half a football stadium for half a game. Math Below, we need a 200 meter cliff with 27,000 tons of water at the top and a place to put it at the bottom. Not counting losses. A ton of water is a cubic meter, so we're talking about roughly an olympic-size swimming pool 20 meters deep at the top and bottom, if I'm doing my math right. 

... now for a typical city we need a couple hundred of those. 

Not a small problem. 

Math Below: 
An American uses about 1.5 kW of electricity on average. You can look it up, or check your electric bill, or go to EIA.gov if you don't believe me. So we're talking about 1.5 kW/person * 10 hours * 1000 people, 15 000 kWh or 15 MWh . 1 watt-hour is 3600 watt-seconds, or 3600 joules . So 54 000 MJ, 54 gigajoules. 

Gravitational energy is mgh. If we have a 200 meter cliff with a pond at the top and a pond at the bottom, and we are on earth (g= 10 m/s^2 ,  close enough) we have 54 x 10^9 kg m^2 /s^2 = 2000 X m^2/s ^2 , X =27 x 10^6 kg . 27 million kg, 27 thousand tons. ",1
